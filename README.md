My Data Projects
Here’s a look at some of the work I’m passionate about:
Predictive Maintenance
This project focuses on using machine learning to improve maintenance strategies, cut costs, and make operations more efficient. By analyzing data, we predict when machines or equipment are likely to fail, helping businesses plan maintenance ahead of time.

Key Features:
Predictive maintenance to avoid unexpected failures.
Optimizing resource allocation for maintenance tasks.
Identifying unusual patterns that may indicate future failures.
Estimating future maintenance costs to help businesses plan budgets.
